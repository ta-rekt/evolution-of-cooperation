# do it
- implement a basic IPD tournament
- choose a subset of the julia language, write down the most common strategies in that language
- come up with a prefix-free binary encoding of that language
- look at the length of the encodings of the strategies you have, look at their pairwise hamming distances
- find the shortest path through these strategies, compute the probability of observing this path from random mutations
- define what happens when an arbitrary string plays the tournament. strategies survive with a probability proportional to their payoff
- build a phylogenetic tree of the shortest strategies that we know survive
- simulate the tournament and see if any strategies emerge on their own, if they confirm your predictions
- how hard is it to show that no matter what strategy is fixed in the population, there will always be another strategy to outcompete it?
